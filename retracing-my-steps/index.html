And the photo of Jupiter and Io is gorgeous. And I'm really a fan of gorgeous things. There's my explanation.</p><p>Enjoy the photo . . . and the rest of this post!</p><p>In 2004/2005, I began putting together a manuscript. I wanted to collect poems that had been set aside, or that did not appear in workshop discussions. I went through my files of widows and orphans (Word documents that contained cut lines from poems, short stories, and flash fiction—fragments to which I was still wed, but couldn't find homes). At that time, I was still writing, though not nearly as often or as diligently or with as much discipline.</p><p>Yesterday's retracing of "Fever Dream" awoke something within me. It felt good to read the poem. And then read again aloud—juxtaposed with our dog Belle's ceaseless snoring. Whoever is out there: Thanks.</p><p>• • •<br>There was so much to say that the walls went deaf and the carpets sweat. There was no one left for us to go to; each other would have been a danger. We never knew who was the last one to "let go," tear or break. Sometimes resentment is the color purple—deep as a cold lake. He required lots of attention—couldn't touch him enough. We never knew he was calling the plumber for oral sex. Someday, this will make an interesting tale.</p><p>• • •<br>Everything is political, even happiness. The train has something to say, and it will be deeper than what you have been saying for weeks. Sometimes we listen to save our souls. Sometimes we listen like leaves. Sometimes we listen to save ourselves. Today is heavier than black <del>ink</del>. Today is better single. Today is better—not whining, <del>pissing, </del>pitching-a-fit. Today is better with orange leaves and bicycles and crab-apple<br>trees. And maybe today'd be better if we just—</p><p>• • •<br>We all had <em>something </em>to say, and the bills were representative of long talks with mothers <em>about </em>the phone bills and brouhaha and homosexual dreams and doped-up nights. Talks charged with a mother's disappointments—six years of education, the heap of loans, misfortune of leaves falling so soon in October. Talks that told of lovers, and of exes living with exes. The awkward things we share—the talks of headaches and. The water tastes like old leaves today.</p><p>• • •<br>A dry mouth has nothing left to say. The space above our heads—heavy with smoke and layers of conversations that are imprints of ghosts. History is easily painted over and (re)touched, a smudge here—<em>the argument in Limerick—</em>an erasure here—<em>the silence of August 7th. </em>If we ignore, or if we rewrite. The past sounds manageable, malleable, as though the sun never sets. And we pour the hot sand into glass vials, our white<br>sand, and we store it for<em>memories. </em>And jealousy is a penny-box of postcards.</p><p>• • •<br>We have something to say. The mail-carrier brings bills and bad cheques, and we survive off the bits of paper. Hand-to-mouth. Nothing is more solid than a full-stop. Nothing is wiser. You asked, "Do you think god is happy?" And you put the pieces (you, me, them, and us) in a<br>paper sack, shook and found: pieces in a paper sack.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="45"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="46"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="47"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="48"><span data-reactid="49"><!-- react-empty: 50 --><h2 data-reactid="51"><a data-reactid="52">|| Project Awake ||</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="55"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="56"></div></section></div></div>
