# Preface: To begin. As if to say, I'm here. Or, I heard a voice.

So, I'm making this a commitment.

A lot about the creative process is hard work---brutally hard. It's a labor of passion. And it requires discipline. In an effort to kick my own ass, I have to set myself some ground rules.

I wrote these rules at 3.39am on a Wednesday, so it feels almost incoherent. That said, I really like the incoherent me. (Seriously. And this is without Ambien.)

### _Here it goes:_

I want to do a video project

but not a video project,

really. Okay, a writing/video/photo/hyperlink-filled---  
A mixed media kind of fusion.

A writing challenge---that pushes me and is reasonably unreasonable.

An ambition.

First thing: it is okay to fail. it is okay to produce shite---even for days, weeks, and months on end. it is okay to voice your frustration with the creative process

---which will be frustrating,

But also like attempting to crawl into an old, well worn, skin.---

---It is okay to embrace small successes. revel in the words.

Language is sensuous, devilish, bedevilling, ludicrous.

It is okay to review old material. And to love it. And to hate it. And to make it better.

Why now? Why? What? What will it mean?

Stop asking. Don't be so scared, idiot. You'll thank me when you wake up.

•••|| THE RULES ||•••

1) This challenge will extend 365 days in duration, starting Saturday, 11th July 2015\.

2) I must write. Daily. (writing here constitutes NOT WORK RELATED WRITING, including work-related tweeting, FaceBooking, LinkedInning, &c.) (writing here means WRITING.)

3) I must spend at least 1 hour a day doing creative work---again, not work related. Think of it as sitting down to a good meal: feed your thoughts deliciousness.

4) I must do a video check-in at least twice a week, holding myself accountable.

5) Show up. Speak your truth. Let go of outcome.

6) When you lose hope (on the third day---I know you), just watch[this][0] again. And then [this][1].
