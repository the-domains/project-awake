# A Little Reflection. A Little Photo Sharing. Part 2 of 3: 7/17/15

So, I have to give a shout out to my dear friend,[@thecuriousrose][0], for being a badass and holding me accountable---she also gave me an incredible shout out, today, for her \#TGIFW, which is utterly appreciated.

I was feeling a little rough, today, so she and her remarkable dude/husband/copilot,[@scottswanson123][1], stopped by and helped me get back into the swing of things (and to celebrate our return from Ireland) by tipping back some Midleton Very Rare Irish Whiskey and sitting through a slideshow of over 500 photos. Bless their cotton socks.

\*\*\*Please note: Midleton and other alcoholic beverages should be consumed responsibly. And if consumed irresponsibly, one should be responsible about the irresponsible behaviour.  
\*\*\*Please note, 1.5: Midleton has special, magical properties that cure migraine headaches, apparently. Not kidding. This notion has been tested. And it is approved.

It's been two weeks since coming back State-side, and tonight was the first night I've had the opportunity to see the photos Dave took of our holiday. What's interesting is that: a) he has an incredible eye, b) his photos made me immediately want to go back, and c) he just needs to take all of our vacation photos. Dave's eye is considerably more nuanced than mine. Seriously.

What occurs to me is that I'm with this guy because he sees the world differently from the way I see the world. And that different perspective makes the world fresh for me. It makes the world come alive in ways I cannot anticipate. And I don't want to anticipate, because the anticipation takes the fun out of discovery. This kind of awakening---this kind of coming alive---doesn't just strike whilst looking at relics of the past. It happens on a daily basis.

They are revelations that happen in the most banal of circumstances, where the ordinary becomes the extraordinary. For the last nine years, we've spent some of the most easy-going and the most harrowing times together. It's his constancy that keeps me filled with the knowing. That there is _the possible, _just lurking under the surface. Of everything. It keeps me engaged. And I'm guilty of not tapping into that.

And then, there are car rides like this:

I'm including a short poem, today. I wrote this for my dear friend Margo, nearing the end of a tough semester. As I close out this week of beginnings for this new blog, I thought I might include a poem that sums up this entire week-long initiation. I'm celebrating not giving up on something new. And I'm relishing what is to come.

## In Response

#### _for Margo_

April came without disaster.

Snow as sad as a mouth unremembered.

The design is always better than the master.

The word "savage": evil, tree, or sediment.

There is nothing left to taste but sand.

And so the branches hang by a voice.

So that there is value, again, in the word_lust._

Resolution takes the form of a wall.

So that the edge can take form.

The form is a buried bottle.

The form must be so that.

So that and so.
