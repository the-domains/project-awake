# In Our Chest

\[I\]

_This is where the tone changes---shifts; as if the tone never _

He says, _I can't go__._I think of sitting in an apartment next year---hovering over Thai take-out as if holy writ. I think _I'll be alone,_ &, _I'll write about being alone._

The light settles somewhere between window & floor. He looks angry.                 & I put the pillows in order. \[&.\] The pillows are in            order.

**------**

Crocuses bend after light.  
Can't stand myself

Any more

Than the person lying  
Beside me.      Than the words

Lying beside me.  
I want to tell him---

These words will hold  
Together like straw.

Our breath, or  
The windows of a house.

**------**

Sever.  
Sever the soul.

Split  
The loaves in

Two.  
Share the halves among

The needy.

**------**

He says, _Split yourself in two---_between this & green & white & being smart. He nods toward the bedroom:

\[This. This is the present tense.\]

------

The angry god moves within the walls: listening to our conversations, he eats our judgements like wrought iron silence._We are content to know nothing. _\[Open the doors. Lock the windows.\] We are content in nothing.

_We do not hear the words: _compassion.             He wrings his fists. He explains how            he climbed a tree in winter. \[He climbed a tree in winter.\] He asks if I have ever seen a mineshaft. Whispers, _No one ever jumped. _Say the word _pushed._

**------**

The trunk swallows the light; the moon drinks from the lake. We take the cold walk with a makeshift torch.     When we arrive at the shore. You swear the stars evaporate---& shudder so hard the clouds clear

to reveal hundreds of                        _stars._

**------**

The birch splits  
In two

Against the window  
---against the fog of. &.

There is nothing to eat  
But the thought of thought.

Word becomes round as egg  
Fits in the case

So _very _well.

Rise. To the sound:  
An alarm inventing

The sort of person one ought to be.  
The room.

\[ii\]

Anchor the light through water.  
Illuminate the orange leaves below.

&.

Rocks rigid.  
Threaten a comely bruise.  
He says, _rocks to pebbles to grass._

Take away hands too quickly.  
This hand is a fake.  
A trick. A shape. An effort.

&.

Anchor sears an image to a hollow, broken tree.  
Forge the sun.  
& he says, _forget the sun_. _Forget the grey hours_.

**------**

He expects: the phone. Yet, only the night air moves between the yellowing lace curtains---the window. The room. He drinks. At his tumbler of scotch and wrestles with the ice. Spins it against the bottom. Stirs the liquor.

Says, _Swallow it whole! Do what you're good at._

The ghost in the closet, the claw-footed tub. (There is a kind of sympathy here---where the ghost is in the closet, the claw-footed tub

The men \[count them\]: there is a signal, and yet the clock is still. & his mouth is still. The men, he counts them. Places them all in a box.

There is a box.

**------**

One asks for three:  
God the.  
God the.  
God the---.

&.

Lights the wick  
to light his wick.

The men \[count them\].  
There is a box

&   lights his wick  
to light his wick.

Remain unconvinced. He has swallowed,  
& there is a bitter------.

They do not go.  
quietly.

They bronze their grins.  
There is always a nail.  
& a ghost behind the eyes.

**------**

He says, _I know every star by name. _The room smells of lavender & lilac.

I am \[he is\] buried under the incongruence of this name \[slave, subject, sycophant\].

The incongruence of every name.

There are no more names.

We know no names.

The sheets paint the night before the light comes through the fiery curtains.

There is a box.

& my hands & his \[. . . . .\] point out and pound the nail.

Is something lost?

Certainly. & some thing has been taken.

\[iii\]

A pale Sunday can walk to church.

The grass is yellowing outside the window------.

He hears:

_Let us join our hands in prayer._

_No, _he says, _let us reconvene and connect at the hips. The holy men appreciate this in November. It __reminds them of ejaculation on Christmas Eve. It reminds them of virgins and saints and soup kitchens._

He thinks, _Piety doesn't exist outside of shrink-wrap: choose a color, a candle. What's the use?_

He says,_When will you stop confessing? All the private---every thing._ He looks warm. Sweats under the yellow knit covers---won't sleep without the fan blowing and the television blaring.  
_Did we confess too much?_

Hold him against the shadow of a waxing moon.

Wants to see what would happen if you took the Eucharist with a false heart.

_God knows the difference between wax souls and real souls. God knows a holy man._

Says, _God is a masochist._

A walk across Spain in July---sandals, bloody feet, prayers.

_This is my body._

He likes it.

But now, the honey is on the plate---the apples are on the plate. He says, _This is a new year._

So, open the closet; select a pair of trousers, kiss the boy good-bye (good-bye), this is the routine:

The habit of being on your knees---

The habit of risk.

& he watches him unpack the scented sorrow from the cedar chest.

It's Tuesday.

And there is more to do.

Except.

It's snowing. There is no more yellowing grass. Only heavy wet snow. There will be ice in the morning---white plate tectonics upon the lawn, creating caverns & moving earth to clear away for a new loch. He takes a palm into his own, counts his breaths---breathes his breath.

Has memorized the smell of his lover's breath.

Conclude: cold silver.

\[iv\]

We have not mentioned the word _ghost._  
The Aspens move by the hand of an unmitigated  
presence.

He says, _I fear._ I say, _I fear._

& _how _relentless our ghosts.

At the Wal-Mart in Fountain. We walk through air thick  
as cinder smoke. Every one resembles the ether,

Our ghosts.

& he says, _I see him everywhere._

I see him too.  
And we admire the young man who comes into view from  
around the corner.

My ghost:

Grey, cut-off shirt in the closet.

Under the fluorescent lights our ghosts murmur; they  
have shape

& they precariously choose a fresh deck of cards.

My tongue cannot form the words---but I wish to say to  
them: _I have let you go!_

**------**

In the sun---on this rock---I watch my ghost flicker,  
run,     jump between the trees below:

a sip of water, a bitter root; I puff the same cigarette &

watch carefully.

_I have let you go._

To be so foolish.

& believe I'd never find---"meaningful."

\[being blind.\]

I conceive that my father's sin is a ghost, & I fear it. I  
listen to its stories & allow it to breathe, take form in the  
shape of running water.

The steam in a blank mirror.

I say, _I am done with ghosts._

And they all push forward & knock.

I am done with our ghosts. They have no.

They have nothing.

& in the steam of the mirror I write.

_Fold into your box._

& I fold into my box.

Into the comfort of our shadow.

& there is comfort.

Finally in our------
