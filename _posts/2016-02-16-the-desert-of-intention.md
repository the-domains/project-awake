# The Desert of Intention

"You came to the desert intending to starve      so starve"  
---[Kazim Ali][0], "Gallery," from _The Far Mosque, _2005\.

It's the third day of this project. 9.42pm.

I've been staring at writing all day---work writing.

We're putting together a new website, and I'm agonizing over the economy of the language; how the electronic space should look; what's the most salient information to be kept. What can and should be let go.

I left the office. 5.10pm.

A haircut can mean the difference between a good day and a bad day. How trivial.

Then back home for a light supper and to take up reading a colleague's chapter for a book. Two hours. And that's the first pass.

I work with genius.

And the work is so dense---it swallowsgulpsengulfs drinks in all light.

I love it.

1997---Fiction Writing Workshop with Ingrid Hill (you can check out an interview with her, [here][1] . . . yeah, she is intense. Genius. Madcap. All of it. And a wicked great writer. I adore this artist.).

During one of our one-on-one sessions, Ingrid suggested I select a short story with which I felt a connection. She said that I should read it aloud once, and then go back and begin to copy it longhand. In doing so, I would experience the musicality of the text; copying it would reveal a kind of simpatico, like tracing the lines of an exquisite calligraphy. The exercise felt a lot like table tapping, or a drunk evening with friends over an ouija board.

All jests aside, it may be useful to trace some of my own work---retracing my steps all the way back to me.

## Fever Dream

I.

I feel the pull. Again.  
Against each damp sheet. The hand feels  
The swell between the clotheslines.  
Flare of sunlight and then. Dark.  
The smell of white twine.  
The body leans against the damp sheets,  
Whets its hands---the cold, taut.

When I am disregarded.  
I become.  
A thick, red cord.  
I eat the white light through  
The sheets, and my voices fail.  
Against the taut  
Fabric.

In my small ear, your history is consecrated:  
A bonfire surrounded.  
Naked witches, dancing.  
I regret. All of the tangible moans, and the witches  
Digging their heels into the grass.

When I was not there.

II.

I confess.  
I am jealous. My dreams are as audible as the blade.  
I awake to hear myself lose the tooth. I confess,  
I had been waiting to lose the root of that tooth.

When inside this room. I am useless.  
And the tea-cups make a false sound:  
Silver ring on tin. A hammer pounds flaking wood.  
The windows:  
Grey lungs, shut as tight as dry lips. Sleep lips.  
I could never stop painting over.  
There are shadows here. Hungry as plastic.

III.

I lie here aware.  
That I have not been.  
This bed is my process. This bed is my mutual:

Histories, impasses, a meticulous mural to  
The anonymous.

This is collision.  
When I think (rarely), and the sun illumines  
The threadbare story.

How elegant. How distilled:  
Lace and light. When am I willing. To strike.  
Bite the eyes,

The middle of this bed.

IV.

A _Suggestion, _a _Notion. _Where was the invitation?  
There was no invitation. I just had  
To climb to the top of a desert mountain. Hands aware and  
Raw. As if they _Could _reach---_Would_reach.  
I lifted this body up to the red rock to see:  
A stiff scorpion, a ring of black eyes,  
A twitching telson. I might say, _Wait. This is my right hand._

And then it will rain.  
(There is a light in this text.)  
There is a loss of senses---  
A burst of red earth---  
Shatters awake.

V.

I decided to remove the histories---  
To remove the notions             (of histories).  
I remove the white sheets from their twine.  
I remove the father in California.  
(A fault-line expires.)  
I wanted to make _that_call.

Will they let us sleep forever?  
Is there room for the burial?  
The empty box and the smell of me.

VI.

And, then, there is the word _suspend:_  
I have come to it, and I am afraid  
I have forgotten what ill-will it represents.  
I think of mirror or talisman.  
There is a box; I leave it empty.  
I enjoy the smells of  
What it could be filled with.

_My histories are a collision.__I think the sun illuminates.  
Impotent white._

It is remarkable we were ever given.  
It is remarkable that I can even sit upright,  
Being that I am such an idiot.  
Memories split open easily. And they are so vivid:  
White as fish belly. I begin to believe  
The word _Memory_is equidistant  
From the word _Murder._

I begin to believe I cannot stomach the word _belief._And then I cannot stomach the word _belief._  
Someone apologize. Someone clean up after this.
