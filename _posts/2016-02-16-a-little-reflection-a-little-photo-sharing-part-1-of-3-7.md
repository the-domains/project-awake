# A Little Reflection. A Little Photo Sharing. Part 1 of 3: 7/16/15

There are few things in this world more enjoyable than what you see above---bread, cheese, wine, olives, cured meats. (I would also add endless pints of cider and Guinness, among other things.) I live for these moments. A perfect amount of delectability, topped off with a hot, fried slab of what-have-you.

It's only made better by sharing it with friends---in an attractive, simple, elegant setting.

Dave---my partner of almost a decade---and I just got back from holiday, two weeks ago. We spent ten days in Ireland.

I drove us across the countryside, from pillar to post, whilst he white-knuckled the "Oh, Shit" bar. It was insane. And amazing.

It was also Dave's first time leaving the North American continent.

I'm going to say, right here and right now, we kind of deserved it. Yup, I'm owning it. We totally deserved this holiday. We haven't really travelled much in a really long time. Since, like, 2009, really.

You see . . . that's us below:

Dave and I . . . we're extraordinarily lucky. I mean, just stupid, effing lucky. (Hold on to yourself, I may just make you barf a little . . . wait for it: We're not rich in the bank accounts, but we're wealthy with contentment (there it is: just let it go. I've just let a rotten clich√© rip, like a wet fart in a cramped elevator---it's gonna get worse). Are you ready? We've got our health, our amazing family, our fantastic friends . . . Yeah, we're just stupid lucky.

We haven't travelled much since we got back together, in 2008\.

I had just left a_really_ toxic relationship---gods bless him; my ex was sweet, at times, but the relationship . . . it just wasn't working; I certainly would never wish him ill; I do ask that he is granted love and kindness and peace. That said, I left the relationship with my cat, my computer, and a lot of bad debt. Dave also was on the market again. (I won't tell the whole story right now, trust me, it'll come out.)

Long story short: we decided that David would come on out to Colorado, we'd make a home together, and see where that took us. In August of 2008, Dave dropped everything and moved to Fort Collins. The rest is history . . . or something like that. He picked up a job at a group home in The Fort, worked his butt off, and I continued to teach for Front Range Community College. After a few months of working for the company, Dave had the opportunity to work for a gentleman as his primary caretaker. The gentleman happened to be quadriplegic and in a wheelchair.

For the record: Dave is the most beautiful, most remarkable, most considerate, most self-sacrificing human being I have met. Ever. I truly thank whatever power/good juju is out there for putting him in my life at the right moment. (Here's the moment where I wistfully and tearfully make sentimental commentary.)

Dave committed a year and a half of his life to being the shadow to this other remarkable young man. He fed him and bathed him; he was his physical therapist; his live-in entertainment. The experience was exhausting, surreal, and a labor of love. But, between Dave's work and my teaching, travelling became less and less of a priority.

And then we move to Alexandria, Virginia---for six months---for me to come to the conclusion that, although being accepted into the George Washington University's Masters of Professional Studies in Strategic Public Relations, I already had a masters degree.

So, after working for Teaching Strategies, as a Contract Editorial Associate, for several months, we moved back to Michigan, January 2011\. I continued teaching my FRCC courses (I was teaching three at the time, making me effectively broke), and Dave was scrimping for work.

I found a job in Owosso, working for the State of Michigan's Department of Human Services, and immediately took the job. We needed money. Dave took to working with his father and brothers, doing construction.

Sure, we got to go camping, as well as small get-aways here and there, but we hadn't had a chance to **Get AWAY **in a very, very, VERY long time.

And so, this year, with Marriage Equality at the front of the newspapers (Dublin voted and passed marriage equality: First country to make it legal by popular vote. Ever. Worldwide. Yeah, a big deal.), we decided that we were going to celebrate by heading over there! And so . . . we did.

We have really great people in our lives. And we were able to go and visit our dear friends: Sally, showing us around Galway, where she's made home for the last six years!

And, then we got to see my dear friend, Marian, whom I've not seen since 1999\. And who, quite honestly, has been sorely and deeply missed. Yeah, she showed us around . . . so much to see. And to share.

Yeah . . .

I'm nearly falling asleep at the wheel, here, so that means I have to listen to my body and turn in. More sharing and writing to come. I mean, you've got me for the next 359 days---which, let's face it, will probably be way longer. At least I hope so!

Thanks for stopping by. More work will be forthcoming! And I think a video check-in will be happening, too, tomorrow!

Ta, for now! And all the love to you and yours!

Very Best,

ADR
