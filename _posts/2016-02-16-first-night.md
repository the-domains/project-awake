# First Night

a ribcage thrums  
deafening---

echos of  
a shattered body

relenting midnight---  
_this is not the world_

_don't panic_  
the steel toe boots

will carry off  
oil-slicked waters

_this is not the world__don't panic_

and the death rattles  
escaping

opulent mouths  
petechial babes

_this is not the cascading,  
militant world_

burial shrouds  
roiling shadows

undulating red expanse  
of desert sands---

the murmurs---  
the rumored village

the hunger---the curled fingers  
of children

burning  
like tires

the same street  
the same gaunt face

the same black smoke---  
the billowing

unfurls toward  
a forgotten---

_this is not the---_black and skyward

swathes of lingerers, shades, and  
wastes
